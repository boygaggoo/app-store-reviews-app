    <string name="welcome">Welcome to this app.
        It is part of my Ph.D Research meanwhile it might help me and others
        improve the testing of Android apps using reviews on Google Play.\n

        It includes a set of reviews for Kiwix apps so you can practice ways
        to apply concepts and skills. Future editions of the app may have
        facilities to import additional reviews.\n

        The app incorporates analytics on how it is being used. These are an
        integral part of the learning and research aspects of this project.
