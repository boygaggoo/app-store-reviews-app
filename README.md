# app-store-reviews-app
Android App to analyse reviews and scripts to load historical reviews data into a SQLite database.

The project includes python3 scripts to load historical data (downloaded from the Google Play Developer Console).

## Getting Started

How does a developer get the app to run? I tried both importing it as an prior project and open existing studio project.

What API level is expected?

For the python code is there any requirements? I am guessing so. These should be in the environment setup or requirements.txt
